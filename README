Third-Party Login Demo
======================

This is a simple demo app to illustrate login with oauth v1/v2 on
appengine. It is not hard to implement all by oneself, but due to the
insufficient/not-up-to-date documentation, it may become a headache.

To use third-party login, you need to register your website on the
corresponding service provider.
